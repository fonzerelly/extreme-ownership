## micromanagement
Note: But my PO has a similar attitude. He thinks that if we apply TDD we tend to "polish the gold as he calls" it. What he cares about is "features, features, features". I get micromanaged.

"Pal, I've got news for you. Your boss can not micromanage you. Do you think I would have time to ask the General for every wall I'm gonna duck behind? Of course not."

## Circles
Note: You are right. Sandro Mancuso wrote in his book "The Softwarecraftsman", that the techiques in the inner blue circle of XP practices are not context specific and therefore do not have to be authorized. So we are free to decide how we work on this level.

That is ok, but you must not lose sight on the vision of your boss, in this case the PO. It is your most important job to backup your boss.
