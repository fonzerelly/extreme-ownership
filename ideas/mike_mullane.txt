when it's my life on the line what type
00:22
of a team do I want out there holding it
00:24
in their palm and the answer I came to
00:26
is I think the identical answer you
00:28
would come to in the identical
00:29
circumstance when your life is on the
00:31
line you're going to want to team this
00:33
the best holding into their palm and how
00:36
two teams get to be the best they get
00:37
there by practicing fundamentals by
00:40
doing little things consistently and
00:42
religiously day in a day out until they
00:44
become as natural as breathing you don't
00:46
even think about it
